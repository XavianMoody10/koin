## Why Make this project
I made this project to demonstrate that I'm kinda getting the gist of how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work. HTML and CSS have been really fun to learn.  When it comes to HTML and CSS,  Even though I've learned a lot there's still so much to learn due to these languages growing very quickly. When it comes to JavaScript, I made a mobile and desktop header turn into a dark theme when scrolling to a specific position on the page. I also created a testimonial slider that slides when clicking on the left and right arrows.
